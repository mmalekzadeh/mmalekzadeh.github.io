Previously, I was a Research Associate at Imperial College London, collaborating with Prof. Deniz Gunduz on Privacy-Preserving and Trustworthy Machine Learning. I earned my PhD in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London while concurrently holding a Research Assistant position at Imperial College London. I had the opportunity to work with Prof. Hamed Haddadi, Dr. Richard G. Clegg, and Prof. Andrea Cavallaro. My PhD research focused on developing machine learning algorithms for privacy-preserving personal data analytics, particularly for data captured by mobile and wearable devices. During my PhD, I also interned at Brave Software Research, where I explored privacy-preserving techniques to enhance content personalization.
