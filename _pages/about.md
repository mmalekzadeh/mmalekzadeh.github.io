I am a <a href='https://www.nokia.com/people/mohammad-malekzadeh/'>Senior Research Scientist</a> at <a href='https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/'> Nokia Bell Labs</a>, and I lead the Device Intelligence team in the <a href='https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/research/sdsr/device-software'> Pervasive Systems</a> department.


In our team, we develop machine learning solutions for private data and personal devices. Our mission is to advance research and development in personalized healthcare applications through multimodal sensing and on-device machine learning. In our solutions, we prioritize multi-modality, data and compute efficiency, individual privacy, and personalization. Our team brings together leading research scientists, brilliant PhD interns and visitors, as well as expert collaborators to drive innovations that elevate human well-being. 
Driven by open-source principles, we publish our code to champion reproducibility and collaborative innovation:

Previously, I was a Research Associate at Imperial College London, collaborating with Prof. Deniz Gunduz on Privacy-Preserving and Trustworthy Machine Learning. I earned my PhD in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London while concurrently holding a Research Assistant position at Imperial College London. I had the opportunity to work with Prof. Hamed Haddadi, Dr. Richard G. Clegg, and Prof. Andrea Cavallaro. My PhD research focused on developing machine learning algorithms for privacy-preserving personal data analytics, particularly for data captured by mobile and wearable devices. During my PhD, I also interned at Brave Software Research, where I explored privacy-preserving techniques to enhance content personalization.
